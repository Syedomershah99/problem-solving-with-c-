Tina is preparing a shopping list containing 
N
 items. She knows the quantity and price of each item on the list. The shop is offering a 
20
%
 discount on the items with a quantity of more than 
100
 units. Given the quantity and price of each of the 
N
 items, your task is to calculate how much each item will cost.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip> // For setting precision
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    while (N--) {
        int quantity, price;
        cin >> quantity >> price;

        double cost;

        // Check for discount and calculate cost
        if (quantity > 100) {
            cost = quantity * price * 0.8; // 20% discount
        } else {
            cost = quantity * price;
        }

        // Print the result with a single digit after the decimal point
        cout << fixed << setprecision(1) << cost << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
