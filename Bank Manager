N
 times. The bank manager told Gaurav, you are allowed to perform only these operations.
1. Copy All – This operation will copy all the printed characters.
2. Paste – This operation will paste all the characters which are already copied.
Gaurav asks you for help to print character P exactly 
N
 times with the minimum number of operations.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T
 denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contain an integer 
N
.

Output Format
Print the minimum number of operations required.


#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(int N) {
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(N); ++i) {
        if (N % i == 0) {
            return i + minOperations(N / i);
        }
    }
    return N; // N is a prime number
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;

        int operations = minOperations(N);

        cout << operations << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
