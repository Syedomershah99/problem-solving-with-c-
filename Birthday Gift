Abhishek and Gaurav are the best friends, today is Gaurav's birthday, but Abhishek forgot to buy a gift for him. Gaurav is very angry with him. Abhishek has an idea for a gift. Gaurav likes coding very much. So Abhishek gave him a problem to solve as his gift. Gaurav likes everything infinitely. Abhishek gave him a sequence problem, such that its first element is equal to 
A
 
(
S
1
=
A
)
, and the difference between any two adjacent elements is (
S
i
 - 
S
i
âˆ’
1
 = 
C
. In particular, Gaurav wonders if his favorite integer 
B
 appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer 
i
, such that 
S
i
 = 
B
. Gaurav is busy at his birthday party, he asks you to solve this problem.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        long long A, B, C;
        cin >> A >> B >> C;

        // Check if B is reachable from A with steps of size C
        if ((B - A) % C == 0 && ((B - A) / C) >= 0) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
