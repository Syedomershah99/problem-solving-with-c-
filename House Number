 to 
N
. Each house will be labelled with a distinct number. Rahul wants to know how many digits he will have to write down as he labels the houses.

Input format
The first line of the input contains integer 
T
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the next 
T
 lines contains one integer denoting the value of 
N
.

Output format
Print the number of digits needed to number all the houses.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int countDigits(int N) {
    return floor(log10(N) + 1);
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;

        int digitsNeeded = countDigits(N);

        cout << digitsNeeded << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
